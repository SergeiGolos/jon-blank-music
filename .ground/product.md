# Product Overview

## Vision and value proposition

- Create a fast, modern, and approachable website for Jon Blank that doubles as:
  - A personal profile and bio hub
  - A music teaching studio site (offerings, pricing, scheduling, testimonials, policies)
  - A music distribution portal (releases, streaming links, EPK, contact)
- Prioritize performance, SEO, and clear calls-to-action (book lessons, listen, contact).

## Primary users and success metrics

- Users
  - Prospective students (and parents) evaluating lessons
  - Fans and industry contacts looking up Jon’s releases and EPK details
  - Local community seeking events, workshops, or collaborations
- Success metrics
  - Lesson inquiry conversions (clicks on “Book a Lesson” / contact form submissions)
  - Streaming/profile click-throughs (Spotify/Apple/YouTube)
  - Page performance (Core Web Vitals) and SEO ranking for music lessons in Jon’s locale

## Scope and content sources

- Canonical bio: `.ground/jon-blank-bio.md`
- Site content: routes and components under `src/` using Qwik + Tailwind
- Media and icons: `public/` folder

## Out-of-scope (initial)

- Custom backend/database; this site ships as a static site
- Complex CMS integration; content authored in-code for v1
- Payment processing (can link out to third-party tools for now)
